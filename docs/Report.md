# Milestone: Digital Signature Algorithm Exploration

## Abstract
The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is an algorithm that allows users to digitally
sign electronic assets or verify a DSA signature. The algorithm is secure 
enough that it is included in the Federal Information Processing Standard 
(FIPS), allowing the algorithm to be used to sign and verify sensitive
government data. 
This milestone will 1) Introduce the concepts and motivation for implementing the
Digital Signature Algorithm 2) Give an overview of the DSA algorithm and its 
properties 3) Discuss the work that has been completed so far 4) Discuss planned
features.
